            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Heyo, I'm <b>Jacob</b>. So this page is just me writing some background on who I am and
                how
                I got into designing video games, if you want the short version of this then
                refer to the CV heading</p>
            <p>Since I was little, I've been <b>obsessed with video games</b>, first playing on a
                hand-me-down Sega Master System and Super Nintendo. As I got older my interests
                gravitated towards <b>PC games</b> like Minecraft, Hearthstone and League of Legends,
                but
                my love for the medium remained. I would also grow obsessed with the creation
                and
                design of video games, endlessly <b>watching YouTube videos</b> on the topic (such as
                Extra
                Credits and Matthewmotis) and writing an entire essay for school titled <b>"Video
                Game's
                effects on humans"</b>.</p>
            <p>When I was 14, we were given a choice of subjects we could take for GCSEs, I was
                eager to learn how to program but I discovered that my school had no such
                option.
                Not to be dissuaded, I <b>began to teach myself Game Maker Studio</b> (Chosen due to
                fixation on Undertale at the time) and through it how to program. I've lost all
                the
                projects I created from this time, from what I remember they were unpolished and
                unfinished, but they <b>taught me to make games</b> and that's what's important. I've
                taken
                this determination forward in my life, I didn't wait until my school taught me
                to
                program, I did it myself. This has led me to develop further skills such as
                learning
                to <b>play the guitar and sketch.</b> </p>
            <p>By College, I set on pursuing a <b>degree in Computer Science</b>, although video games
                were
                what I loved, I became anxious about my ability to enter such a competitive
                industry.
                Later, I would come to quite regret not taking a course in Game Design. I
                completed
                my <b>A-Levels in History, Maths and Computer Science</b> achieving an <b>A in all three</b>
                and
                enrolling at the <b>University of Birmingham</b>. Over the next 4 years, I grew less
                interested in Computer Science and realised that creating video games was what I
                wanted to do. The skills I learnt at university were immensely useful for
                achieving
                this goal (especially learning to program well) but it became clear that I
                wanted to
                enter the game industry as opposed to a traditional Computer Science position.
            </p>
            <p>I began <b>participating in Game Jams</b> to start adding content to my portfolio and
                boosting my abilities. I ended up taking a year out of university due to
                personal
                reasons and spent this time creating video games, some successful some less so,
                but
                the lessons were learnt. For my final year <b>dissertation</b>, I would create a
            <b>gamified
                fishing app</b> to achieve a high grade for my degree while also furthering my
                skills.
            <b>In 2023 I would graduate with First-class honours</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, I've been living at home, working part-time jobs to keep money coming
                and
                performing <b>volunteer IT work at a local heritage site</b>. My free time is spent
                developing
                video game projects and adding to my portfolio. My short-term goal at the moment
                is
                to <b>land a job in the video game industry and begin gaining professional
                experience</b>
                in the field I've decided I want to be in. So yeah, if you're a recruiter who
                read
                all the way to here, hire me! please!</p>

        <h2>Influences</h2>
        <p>I believe experiencing and appreciating art is one of the best parts of being alive,
            I'm therefore VERY attached to works which have affected me in some way. Here's a
            list of some of my favourites over the years.
        </p>
        <p><b> Games:</b> <b>Undertale</b> was what got me into game design, I just loved the idea of
            making a game as good as it. The game I've probably played the most is <b>Minecraft</b>,
            I've loved that since I was little, but others in that time-wasting genre I enjoy
            are <b>Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress, Civilization and Terraria</b>. I played <b>League of Legends</b>
            for many years but am thankfully 1 year clean now, I still dabble in a bit of
        <b>Hearthstone</b> though. Other series to mention are <b>Mario, Pokemon and Persona</b>
            along with some indies I love like <b>Ultrakill, Hollow Knight and Binding of Isaac</b>.
        </p>
        <p><b>Music:</b> <b>Aphex Twin</b> is my beloved and has caused my music taste to be mostly electronic
            dance with artists like <b>Machine Girl, Daft Punk, Lone, Flying Lotus, Crystal
            Castles, LCD Soundsystem, Underworld</b> and so on. I'm super big into <b>Talking Heads</b>,
            love dream pop by artists like <b>My Bloody Valentine or Cocteau Twins</b>, and love the
            pop music of <b>Bjork, Kate Bush, Charli XCX and Kero Kero Bonito</b>. I'm very specific
            about the music I listen to while programming; If I'm stressed out then I put on
            ambient music, if I've just had a coffee and need to be efficient then it's 90s
            jungle, and if I just need to lose hours then instrumental hip-hop does the trick.</p>
        <p><b>Books:</b> I served two non-concurrent terms as the treasurer of the <b>Game of Thrones</b>
            society, I adore those books (even if they are a little problematic) and can read them over and
            over. I've read through <b>The Witcher</b> series and recently fell in love with the world
            of <b>The Expanse</b> which is another fantastic read. I've also tried to get some classic
            literature under my belt with books like <b>Catch-22, 1984, A Clockwork Orange and The
            Handmaid's Tale</b>.
        </p>
        <p><b>Television:</b> Big fan of HBO dramas like <b>The Wire, The Sopranos and Succession</b> but I'll
            always contend that the greatest TV show ever made is <b>The Simpsons</b>, utterly
            brilliant. I also watch a lot of anime because I'm very cool, I'm currently keeping
            up with <b>Jujutsu Kaisen, Blue Lock, Chainsaw Man, and Jojo's Bizzare Adventure</b> while
            some old favourites of mine are <b>Cowboy Bebop, Full-Metal Alchemist, Steins Gate and
            Death Note</b>.
        </p>
        <p><b>Movies:</b> Probably the medium I interact with the least; I'm a big fan of <b>Dennis
            Villeneuve</b> movies as I like sci-fi and <b>David Lynch</b> as I enjoy pretending I'm smarter
            than I am. Off the top of my head, my five favourites, in no order, are <b>Blade Runner
            2049, Uncut Gems, Hot Fuzz, Mulholland Drive and The Silence of the Lambs</b>.</p>
