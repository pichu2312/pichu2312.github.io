  <h2>Experienced programmer and avid game designer</h2>

    <p>Heyo, I'm <strong>Jacob</strong>, I'm a hobbyist game programmer and designer looking
      to break into the industry. I graduated from the <strong>University of Birmingham</strong> in 2023
      with <strong>first-class honours in Computer Science</strong>, since then I've been
      working on personal game projects whilst being an IT volunteer at a cultural
        heritage site.</p>

      <p>
    I have a passion for creating games and have been doing it for nearly a decade
      creating games in <strong>Unity, Game Maker Studio, Android Studio,
        Javascript</strong> and more. Using my free time to cultivate the skills I have
      is an important principle I follow and has led to my continued growth after
      graduating.</p>

      <p>I recently participated in <strong>Limit Break 2024</strong> which has given me new challenges and opportunities to progress my development skills</p>

<p>Here's a look at how I code through an NPC class I wrote for my 2024 gamejam submission 'Dancing Mania'. Players need to perform a combo to recruit NPCs who proceed to circle and dance around the player. Two classes inherit from this; aggressive attackers who chase the player and special NPCs who have dialogue. </p>
