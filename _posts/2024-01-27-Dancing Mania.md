Between the 14th and 17th centuries, there were numerous occurrences of mass hysteria causing groups of people to dance uncontrollably until they collapsed from exhaustion or even death.  Historians are still unsure of the cause.

Experience the outbreak first-hand, travel through a quiet hamlet rendered in traditional medieval marginalia (which was the style at the time!) and spread the joy of dance by performing combos.

Well this game jam went pretty well. My development skills had evolved a lot by this point and, despite juggling work and other commitments, the game was completed to a stable position within the time frame. There was very little research needed to achieve the goals I wanted as I had already learned how to perform them.

Most of the art for this game was provided by my good friend Hannah Goodliff who you can follow on Twitter @HGoodliff.
