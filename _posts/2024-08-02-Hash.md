This project was created using a tutorial and is not my own work! 

This series of tutorials explored creating random surfaces in Unity, the first of which is the above. A grid of cubes was generated and the y coordinate and colour were determined by feeding its position into a hashing algorithm. It also spent some time exploring vectorization in Unity as the burst compiler performs more efficiently on groups of four values than on each individually.
