This project was created using a tutorial and is not my own work! 

Use + and - to increase and decrease the resolution.

This tutorial started by making a script which created prefab cubes along with a custom shader to change their colour based on world space before expanding into more complicated patterns. Unity's profiling tools were showcased exploring the graphs FPS using different settings such as BRP, URP, enabling dynamic batching and GPU instancing. Finally, the project was pushed to its most efficient using a compute shader which moved much of the computations onto the GPU.
