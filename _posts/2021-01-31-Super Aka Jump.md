Control Aka the Red Panda, our loveable protagonist, and help him take back his forest from the evil Booker Gang! The Booker Gang have built a library in Akaâ€™s Bamboo forest, disturbing his peace. Use the collectables, to power yourself up, and reclaim the ground Aka has lost in this crazy adventure!

The twist with the game is that you don't play as Aka, but instead, a key that the protagonist failed to pick up, it's a cute idea if a little too fourth wall breaky nowadays. This was the first gamejam I did and it makes me quite nostalgic, even if it's plagued with bugs and errors its got alot of love poured into it. I did all the art as well as the programming which I would NEVER like to do within 72 hours again, but it helped advance my skills anyway. Have a look if you're curious.

Thanks to Rose Summers and Eve Butt in development of this game.
