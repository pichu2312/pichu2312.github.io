This is a parody dating simulator visual novel about getting isekai’d into a fantasy world to date monsters and a wizard. This might sound great on paper, but some guy has cursed you, and the dialogue choices are random… 

Pick from a variety of thoughts, both negative and positive, to weigh the odds in your favour! Try to think about their personality, as well as potential ‘genre tropes’, when deciding what options to pick, sometimes it might be surprising.

It was a blazing hot summer and my friends and I wanted to make to do a game jam together, plus we wanted to do a dating game. We were all new to game jams at the time, but I think the final result came out quite successfully. 

Team organisation was the main skill I got to practice during this, making sure the artist and the writers knew what they should be working on to create a completed project on time. Clear communication and setting goals for other members was a must, development needed to be done concurrently and not one after the other. Future projects that involved my collaboration with others went a lot better thanks to what I learned from this event.

A thanks to Hannah Goodliff for doing the art, Eve Butt and Connor Couch for the writing and Rose Summers for helping with the concept.
