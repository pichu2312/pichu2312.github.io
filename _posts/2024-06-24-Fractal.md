This project was created using a tutorial and is not my own work! 

An extension of the graph tutorial, the fractal begins similarly with the spheres being rendered as individual objects before moving this work onto the GPU. The next part used Unity's job system to split tasks into chunks which can be run concurrently on the CPU using the burst compiler.
